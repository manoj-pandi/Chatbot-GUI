Welcome to Chatbot-GUI, a chatbot webpage created with Python and integrated with OpenAI's powerful language capabilities!

## Pre-installation

Before you get started, make sure to follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Install the `gradio` library.
   ```bash
   pip install gradio
2.Install the OpenAI Python library.
 pip install openai


#Requirements:ðŸ”‘
To make the chatbot work seamlessly, you need to do the following:

Create an account on the OpenAI platform and obtain an API "key" for your Chatbot project. This key will be used for API authentication.

Ensure that you use a valid API key before it expires. If the key expires, the chatbot won't function properly. You can renew the key by subscribing to OpenAI.

#Usage:ðŸš€
Once you have set up your environment and obtained an API key, you're ready to run the Chatbot-GUI. You can do this by running the main script.
python chatbot_gui.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:7860 to interact with your chatbot.
